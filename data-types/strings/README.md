The `strings.rb` file has a number of exercises to help you better work with strings in ruby.  

Below is a list of methods that will help you complete the exercises - research each of them on the [Ruby Docs for Strings](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/String.html) to learn more about what they do and how they are used.

There are additional methods that you will need to complete the exercises; each of these additional methods can be found in the Ruby Docs for Strings.

* `String#capitalize`[docs](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/String.html#method-i-capitalize)
* `String#concat`[docs](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/String.html#method-i-concat)

Here's a [companion piece to working through these exercises](https://josh.works/turing-backend-prep-02-first-tests-and-making-them-pass).

An alumn has put together [a video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKqo2w0W7S0) for this `strings.rb` test, as well. 

These two resources, combined, should help get you up and running. 

Finally, you'll be getting your first introduction to `Minitest` in this file!

#### What is minitest?

When you cloned this repo and ran `bundle` you installed the `minitest`.  

Many of the `.rb` files in this repo begin with calling `minitest`, like:

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/pride'
require 'pry'

class StringTest < Minitest::Test
```
So what is minitest and what's going on above? Great question! 

See the references to minitest at the top of the file? `minitest/autorun` and `minitest/pride`?

These are “modules” of the `minitest` gem.

I strongly recommend “pausing” this exercises and reading (and re-reading, and write all the code from all the examples in) this excellent guide: [https://launchschool.com/blog/assert-yourself-an-introduction-to-minitest](https://launchschool.com/blog/assert-yourself-an-introduction-to-minitest)

I’ll state that again. Read and study the Minitest guide. It is fantastic and will set you up for success for the rest of Turing:

[...]

Did you read the Launch School post? Great! Then most of what is in this file should look a lot more readable to you.

As a quick test, answer the following questions:

- What is minitest?
- what is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)?
- What does assert_equal mean? How many arguments does it expect?
- Will assert_equal true, "true" pass?
- How do you “run” a test file?
- is a “failing” test a bad thing?
- does minitest run all the tests in order?
- Find a list of minitest assertions (google it!). What’s a cool one you found?

Awesome. If you can answer all of those questions, you’ve got your head wrapped around Minitest. Onward!
